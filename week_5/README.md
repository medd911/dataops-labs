# Week 5: Hooks, Exposures, and Documentation

Welcome to Week 5 of the DataOps & dbt Mentorship Program! This week we shift from writing SQL to making our project **production-ready**. You will learn how to automatically run post-processing commands after a model builds, declare which dashboards depend on your data, and write documentation that makes your work understandable to the whole team.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before starting Week 5, make sure you have completed **all of Week 4**:

- [ ] `packages.yml` installed and `dbt deps` succeeds
- [ ] `macros/convert_currency.sql` working
- [ ] `macros/calculate_revenue.sql` working
- [ ] `macros/macros.yml` with both macros documented
- [ ] `models/dev/fct_monthly_revenue.sql` using Jinja loops
- [ ] `models/dev/fct_order_details.sql` updated with surrogate key and macros

> **If your Week 4 models are not working yet, fix them first.** Week 5 builds directly on top of them.

## 📖 Lesson Overview

### What are Hooks?

A **hook** is a SQL statement that dbt runs automatically at a specific point in the model lifecycle. You configure them once and they fire every time the model builds — no manual steps required.

dbt supports two hook types:

| Hook | When It Runs |
| --- | --- |
| `pre_hook` | **Before** the model's SQL executes |
| `post_hook` | **After** the model's table/view is created |

The most common use case is `post_hook` — for example, creating an index on a freshly built table to speed up downstream queries.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["dbt run"] --> B["Model SQL Executes<br/>(CREATE TABLE ...)"]
    B --> C["post_hook Fires<br/>(CREATE INDEX ...)"]
    C --> D["Model Ready<br/>for Queries"]
```

**Hooks can be defined at two levels:**

- **Model level** — inside the `config()` block of a single model file. Use this when the hook only makes sense for one specific model.
- **Project level** — inside `dbt_project.yml` under the models block. Use this when the same hook should apply to all models in a layer.

### What are Exposures?

An **exposure** is a YAML definition that tells dbt about a downstream consumer of your data — such as a dashboard, a report, an ML model, or an API.

Without exposures, dbt has no idea what uses your models. When you add an exposure, dbt can:
- Show it in the **lineage graph** (`dbt docs serve`)
- Warn you when an upstream model that a dashboard depends on is broken

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["stg_orders"] --> B["fct_order_details"]
    C["stg_customers"] --> D["dim_customers"]
    B --> E["📊 Revenue Dashboard<br/>(Exposure)"]
    D --> E
    B --> F["📋 Inventory Report<br/>(Exposure)"]
```

### What is dbt Documentation?

dbt lets you write plain-English descriptions for every model and every column directly in YAML files. These descriptions appear in the **dbt docs site** — a searchable, auto-generated data catalog that anyone on the team can browse.

Good documentation answers three questions:
1. **What** does this table contain?
2. **How** is each column calculated?
3. **Why** does this model exist (what business question does it answer)?

## 📝 Assignment Tasks

### Task 5.1 — Post-Hook: Create Indexes (25 pts)

Add `post_hook` entries to two DEV models so that PostgreSQL indexes are created automatically every time the model is rebuilt.

**What you need to do:**

| Model | Indexes to Create |
| --- | --- |
| `fct_order_details` | Index on `order_date`, Index on `customer_id` |
| `dim_customers` | Index on `country` |

**Rules:**
- Always use `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` so the hook is **idempotent** (safe to run more than once)
- Name your indexes with a consistent pattern: `idx_<model_name>_<column>`
- The hook must go inside the model's `config()` block

**💡 Code Hints:**

For `fct_order_details.sql`, update the top `config()` block:

```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='incremental',
        unique_key='order_item_id',
        post_hook=[
            "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_fct_order_details_order_date   ON {{ this }} (order_date)",
            "CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_fct_order_details_customer_id  ON {{ this }} (customer_id)"
        ]
    )
}}
```

For `dim_customers.sql`, update its `config()` block:

```sql
{{
    config(
        materialized='table',
        post_hook="CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_dim_customers_country ON {{ this }} (country)"
    )
}}
```

> **Key concept:** `{{ this }}` is a dbt variable that resolves to the fully-qualified table name (e.g., `"ecommerce"."DEV"."fct_order_details"`). You must use it in hooks instead of hardcoding the table name.

> **Note:** When a model only has one hook, you can pass a string instead of a list. When it has multiple hooks, use a list `[...]`.

**Testing your work:**

```bash
# Rebuild fct_order_details with hooks
dbt run --select fct_order_details --full-refresh --profiles-dir .

# Rebuild dim_customers with hooks
dbt run --select dim_customers --profiles-dir .
```

Then verify the indexes were created in your SQL client:

```sql
-- Check that indexes were created
SELECT indexname, tablename, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'DEV'
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
```

You should see `idx_fct_order_details_order_date`, `idx_fct_order_details_customer_id`, and `idx_dim_customers_country` in the results.

**Deliverable:** Updated `fct_order_details.sql` and `dim_customers.sql` with `post_hook` in the `config()` block.

| Criteria | Points |
| --- | --- |
| Correct `post_hook` syntax in model config | 5 |
| Index uses `IF NOT EXISTS` to be idempotent | 10 |
| Models build without errors | 5 |
| Student can query `pg_indexes` to verify the index was created | 5 |

---

### Task 5.2 — Post-Hook: Grant Permissions (10 pts)

Add a **project-level** post-hook in `dbt_project.yml` that runs a `GRANT` statement after every DEV model is built.

**What you need to do:**

Add a `+post_hook` to the `dev` layer in `dbt_project.yml` so that every table in the DEV schema is automatically granted `SELECT` access to all users.

**💡 Code Hints:**

Open `dbt_project.yml` and update the `dev` block:

```yaml
models:
  dbt_learning:
    stage:
      +schema: STAGE
      +materialized: view

    dev:
      +schema: DEV
      +materialized: table
      +post_hook: "GRANT SELECT ON {{ this }} TO PUBLIC"
```

> **Why `TO PUBLIC`?** In PostgreSQL, `PUBLIC` is a built-in pseudo-role that represents all users. Granting to `PUBLIC` makes the table readable by any database user — useful for giving BI tools read access without managing individual user permissions.

> **Key concept:** A project-level hook applies to **all** models in that directory (all of `models/dev/**`). It runs in addition to any model-level hooks — so `fct_order_details` will run both its index hooks AND the GRANT hook.

**Testing your work:**

```bash
# Run all dev models to trigger the project-level hook
dbt run --profiles-dir .
```

Then verify in your SQL client:

```sql
-- Check that GRANT was applied (look for PUBLIC in grantee column)
SELECT grantee, table_schema, table_name, privilege_type
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants
WHERE table_schema = 'DEV'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Deliverable:** Updated `dbt_project.yml` with `+post_hook` under the `dev` layer.

| Criteria | Points |
| --- | --- |
| Hook is defined at the project level (not model level) | 5 |
| `{{ this }}` correctly references the model being built | 5 |

---

### Task 5.3 — Exposures (25 pts)

Create `models/dev/_exposures.yml` that declares two downstream consumers of your dbt models.

**What you need to do:**

Define two exposures:

1. **Revenue Dashboard** — depends on `fct_order_details` and `dim_customers`
2. **Inventory Report** — depends on `stg_products` and `fct_order_details`

Each exposure must include:
- `name` — machine-readable identifier (snake_case)
- `type` — one of: `dashboard`, `notebook`, `analysis`, `ml`, `application`
- `maturity` — one of: `low`, `medium`, `high`
- `owner` — with `name` and `email` fields
- `depends_on` — list of model refs
- `description` — meaningful description (not just the name restated)

**💡 Code Hints:**

Create `models/dev/_exposures.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2

exposures:

  - name: revenue_dashboard
    type: dashboard
    maturity: high
    owner:
      name: "Your Name"
      email: "your@email.com"
    description: >
      The main revenue dashboard used by the sales and finance teams.
      Shows daily, monthly, and cumulative revenue broken down by store,
      product category, and customer country. Refreshed nightly.
    depends_on:
      - ref('fct_order_details')
      - ref('dim_customers')

  - name: inventory_report
    type: analysis
    maturity: medium
    owner:
      name: "Your Name"
      email: "your@email.com"
    description: >
      A weekly inventory and product performance report used by the
      procurement team. Tracks stock turnover rates, identifies
      low-margin products, and flags items with abnormal discount rates.
    depends_on:
      - ref('stg_products')
      - ref('fct_order_details')
```

> **Tip:** Replace `"Your Name"` and `"your@email.com"` with your actual details — the grading script checks that the `owner` fields are filled in.

**Testing your work:**

```bash
# Compile to validate the YAML syntax
dbt compile --profiles-dir .

# Generate docs and open the docs site
dbt docs generate --profiles-dir .
dbt docs serve --profiles-dir .
```

In the docs site, click on **"Exposures"** in the left sidebar. You should see your two exposures listed. Click on one to view its lineage graph — it will show which models feed into the exposure.

**Deliverable:** `models/dev/_exposures.yml`

| Criteria | Points |
| --- | --- |
| Both exposures defined with correct syntax | 10 |
| `depends_on` correctly lists model refs | 5 |
| Owner information is filled in | 5 |
| Descriptions are meaningful (not placeholder text) | 5 |

---

### Task 5.4 — Model Documentation (25 pts)

Write descriptions for all your models and their key columns in YAML schema files.

**What you need to do:**

1. Update `models/stage/_schema.yml` to add a `description` to every staging model
2. Create `models/dev/_schema.yml` with descriptions for every DEV model **and** full column-level documentation for `fct_order_details` and `dim_customers`

**💡 Code Hints:**

**`models/stage/_schema.yml`** — add model-level descriptions:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: stg_customers
    description: >
      Cleaned and standardised customer records from the raw seed data.
      Trims whitespace from names, lowercases email addresses, and casts
      signup_date to a proper date type. One row per customer.

  - name: stg_products
    description: >
      Cleansed product catalog from raw seed data. Trims product names,
      casts prices to numeric(12,2), and converts is_active from text to
      boolean. One row per product.

  - name: stg_orders
    description: >
      Cleaned order headers. Lowercases and trims order_status, casts
      order_date to date, and defaults null shipping_fee values to 0.

      One row per order line item.

  - name: stg_store_locations
    description: >
      Cleaned store location dimension. Trims all text fields and casts
      opened_date to date. One row per store.
```

**`models/dev/_schema.yml`** — model-level + column-level documentation:

```yaml
version: 2

        description: >
          Total amount converted to USD using fixed exchange rates
          (1 OMR = 2.60 USD, 1 EUR = 1.08 USD). Used for cross-currency comparisons.

  - name: dim_customers
    description: >
      Customer dimension table aggregating order history per customer.
      Joins stg_customers with order totals to provide a single view of
      each customer's profile and spending behaviour.
    columns:

      future order dates, missing customer IDs, negative shipping fees, or invalid
      status values. Used for investigation and upstream data fix tracking.
```

> **What makes a good description?**
> - Explains **what the column means**, not just what it's named
> - Notes **how it is calculated** when the value is derived
> - Mentions **units or ranges** when relevant (e.g., "0–100", "USD")
> - Is written so a new team member can understand it without reading the SQL

**Testing your work:**

```bash
# Validate your YAML and generate the docs site
dbt docs generate --profiles-dir .
dbt docs serve --profiles-dir .
```

Navigate to `fct_order_details` in the docs site. You should see:
- A model description at the top
- A full column list with descriptions

**Deliverable:** `models/stage/_schema.yml` (updated) + `models/dev/_schema.yml` (new)

| Criteria | Points |
| --- | --- |
| All models have descriptions | 5 |
| All columns in `fct_order_details` documented | 10 |
| All columns in `dim_customers` documented | 5 |
| Descriptions are clear and helpful (not just the column name restated) | 5 |

---

### Task 5.5 — Generate and Review Docs Site (15 pts)

Generate the dbt documentation site and take screenshots proving everything is connected.

**What you need to do:**

1. Run `dbt docs generate` to build the catalog
2. Run `dbt docs serve` to open the docs site in your browser
3. Take three screenshots:
   - The **DAG (lineage graph)** showing your full project from seeds → stage → dev → exposures
   - The **documentation page** for `fct_order_details` showing model description and column list
   - The **exposure page** for either `revenue_dashboard` or `inventory_report` showing its upstream dependencies

**💡 How to navigate the docs site:**

| What to find | Where to look |
| --- | --- |
| Lineage graph | Click any model → bottom panel shows the DAG |
| Full project DAG | Click "**Lineage**" in the top navigation |
| Exposures | Left sidebar → "**Exposures**" |
| Model docs | Left sidebar → expand **dbt_learning** → **Models** → **dev** or **stage** |

**Testing your work:**

```bash
# Step 1 — Build the catalog (reads compiled SQL + run results)
dbt docs generate --profiles-dir .

# Step 2 — Open the docs site (available at http://localhost:8080)
dbt docs serve --profiles-dir .
```

> **Tip:** If port 8080 is in use, specify a different port: `dbt docs serve --port 8081 --profiles-dir .`

**Deliverable:** Three screenshots saved in your submission folder:
- `screenshot_dag.png`
- `screenshot_fct_order_details_docs.png`
- `screenshot_exposure.png`

| Criteria | Points |
| --- | --- |
| Docs generate without errors | 5 |
| DAG screenshot shows correct lineage | 5 |
| Exposure visible in docs | 5 |
